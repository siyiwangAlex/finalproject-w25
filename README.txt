
# Redesign of Ann Arbor Bus Stops – Project Website

## Overview

This website was created as part of my SI 539 Web Design final project.  
It showcases the research process, design ideas, and final outcomes of the "Redesigning Bus Stops in Ann Arbor" project.

The structure of the site is based on a responsive template that utilizes a row-based layout system.  
However, all visual content, page structure, design elements, and coding customizations were developed by myself to tailor the project’s specific needs.

## Key Features

- **Custom Layouts:**  
  Every page was manually designed and organized based on the research workflow, ensuring clarity and relevance to the project.

- **Row System Usage:**  
  The original template’s `.row` and `.col-` system was used to maintain responsive grid layouts, especially for research process pages and image galleries.

- **Customized Styling:**  
  Fonts, color palette, button styles, lightbox gallery, and mobile responsiveness were all customized.  
  Several CSS modules were cleaned and rewritten to better fit the project’s design goals.

- **JavaScript Enhancements:**  
  - A lightweight, custom-built lightbox functionality for image previewing.
  - Dynamic gallery popup for grouped design deliverables.
  - Custom form submission integration via Formspree.

- **Accessibility Improvements:**  
  - Semantic HTML structure.
  - Proper form labels and contrast ratio adjustments.
  - Mobile-friendly viewport settings without disabling user scaling.

## Notes
