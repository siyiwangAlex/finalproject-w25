          <p>To further understand the bus stop ecosystem in Ann Arbor, we conducted in-depth stakeholder interviews
            using ethnographic methods. These included:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>The Ride Administrators</strong> – We interviewed Jeff Pfeifer, Manager of Public Affairs and
              Engagement at TheRide. He shared the organization’s priorities and highlighted the limited resources
              available for infrastructure changes.</li>

            <li><strong>Bus Riders</strong> – Through conversations with students, elderly residents, and daily
              commuters, we identified common pain points such as inconvenient stop locations, insufficient shelter,
              long detour routes, and a lack of clear maps or seating.</li>

            <li><strong>Bus Drivers</strong> – We attempted to connect with drivers at the end of their shifts, but were
              unable to establish meaningful dialogue due to time and scheduling constraints.</li>

            <li><a href="https://www.neighborhoodinstitute.org/"><strong>Kirk Westphal (The Neighborhood
                  Institute)</strong></a> – We consulted with Kirk on how public transit supports connected and
              sustainable communities. He offered insight into broader structural and societal limitations in public
              transit development.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We contacted these individuals through personal networks and local online communities, including Ann
            Arbor-based Reddit and Facebook groups.</p>

          <p>We created a stakeholder map identifying groups such as resource providers, direct users, policy
            influencers, and system-level opponents. Each group was evaluated in terms of their power and impact on the
            problem space.</p>

          <p>Recurring challenges emerged during these interviews — including bus stops with no shelter or seating, poor
            visibility for drivers, and stops poorly integrated with pedestrian paths. These issues are often tied to
            regulatory constraints or logistical limitations.</p>
          <p>In addition to interviews, we conducted a survey to gather broader public input via Google Forms. This
            survey explored people’s experiences using the bus system, their impressions of stops, and suggestions based
            on other cities they’ve lived in. It was distributed through our networks and social platforms.</p>
          <p>These stakeholder interviews provided us with valuable insights into both the human and systemic sides of
            the bus stop experience. We uncovered user pain points such as discomfort, confusion, and poor
            accessibility, as well as organizational challenges like limited funding and infrastructure constraints.
            These learnings shaped our understanding of what solutions would be both impactful and realistically
            feasible — grounding our future design decisions in real-world perspectives.</p>
